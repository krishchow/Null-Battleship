Mac - Initalize virtual environment

```bash
# create a virtualenv called 'venv' and use it.
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv

# venvdotapp helps the python be a mac 'app'. So the pygame window can get focus.
pip3 install requirements.txt

# See if pygame works with the oo module, and the aliens example.
